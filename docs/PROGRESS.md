# Progress log

Working branch: **`v2`**. `main` is untouched and still matches the live site.
Nothing is deployed to Cloudflare — Isaac deploys.

## How to resume (for Claude)

1. `git clone https://github.com/yitzhach/ia-art-claude-code && cd ia-art-claude-code && git checkout v2`
2. Read `docs/V2-PLAN.md` (checklist) and the latest entry below.
3. `npm ci && npm run build` to confirm a clean state, then continue with the next unchecked item.
4. Commit + push to `v2` after every meaningful step.

Reference material: the v1 site lives on `main` (`git show main:index.html`). The original Claude Design
project is the artifact "5pm-8-18-NEW--ART-HOMEPAGE" (claude.ai/artifact/CZSKb33Z1rrwD7WkDqArVe).
